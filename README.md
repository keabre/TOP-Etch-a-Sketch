# TOP-Etch-a-Sketch

This is a project idea provided by 'The Odin Project'. Their lesson provides me with guided steps on how to create this project and what it is supposed to do and look like.

My goals for creating this project are:
- to get more familiar with using DOM Manipulation
- to get more practice planning and writing pseudocode
- to gain more experience creating a project from scratch, start to finish
