# Project Plan

## Guidance steps provided by The Odin Project

1. Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs

2. Set up a 'hover' effect so that the grid divs change colour when your mouse passes over them, leaving a (pixelated) trail through your grid like a pen would

3. Add a button on the top of the screen that will send the user a popup asking for the number of squares per side for the new grid, Once entered, the existing grid should be removed, and a new grid should be generated in the same total space as before so that you've got a new sketch pad

## My rewording of the project for adhanced understanding

Create an Etch-a-Sketch project with an embedded section acting as the board to 'sketch' on along with a button above it that allows the user the enter how many squares per side they want the grid to be through a popup, if they want more or less than what's provided by default.

The default board will consist of 16 squares each way.

The user generated board should take the same amount of pixel space as the default board, just with bigger or smaller squares

The Sketching board will simulate sketch through the squares changing colour when their mouse hovers over it 

(I'm assuming it is up to me whether I want it to be a mouseover event or a mousedown event)
